# Bee Health Monitoring

## Overview

Honeybee Health AI is an ML-based web application for beekeepers that predicts health of the bees from beehive images. We used a pre-trained object detection model to detect bees and trained a convolutional neural network model to predict the health of each bee. We built our ML product using microservices architecture and deployed our containerized services to GCP
